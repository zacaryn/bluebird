# Bluebird Mortgage Website â€“ Internal Overview

This repository contains the production website for Bluebird Mortgage. It is a statically exported Next.js application with a lightweight Node service used for lead/inquiry processing via AWS. The codebase emphasizes performance, maintainability, and strong on-page SEO for mortgage-related queries in Colorado.

## What was built

- Responsive marketing website with program-specific content (VA, FHA, Conventional, Refinance, Reverse, etc.)
- Conversion paths: lead capture (Get Started) and contact forms
- Admin views for inquiries/leads (protected)
- Robust SEO implementation (Next.js metadata API, Open Graph, Twitter cards, JSON-LD)
- Static export for fast delivery behind an Nginx front-end with 301 host canonicalization

## Tech stack

- Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- Static export (`output: 'export'`) for the web UI
- Node/Express service in `server.js` for API endpoints
- AWS: DynamoDB (leads/inquiries), Cognito (admin auth), SES via `lib/send-email.js`

## Architecture highlights

- UI: `src/app` directory with route-level metadata and JSON-LD where appropriate
- Global SEO: `src/app/layout.tsx` sets defaults (Open Graph, Twitter, verification, WebSite/Organization schema)
- Components: reusable UI in `src/components` (SEO head, forms, navigation, etc.)
- API service: `server.js` exposes `/api/*` routes, integrates with AWS, and includes rate limiting and JWT verification
- Static assets and SEO files: `public/` (robots.txt, sitemap.xml, manifests, images)

## SEO implementation

- Next.js Metadata API for titles/descriptions per page and Open Graph/Twitter tags
- Structured data: `WebSite`, `Organization`, `WebPage`, `FAQPage`, and relevant `ImageObject` JSON-LD
- Canonicals and site name: configured to the apex domain; `alternateName` provided to reinforce brand sitename in Google
- robots and sitemap: explicit `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` maintained in `public/`

## Deployment notes

- Static build deployed behind Nginx with 301 redirect from `www` to apex domain
- Ensure environment variables for AWS and JWT are provided for the Node service
- Image optimization is disabled for static export; assets are served from `public/`

## Environment/configuration

- `next.config.js`: static export, trailingSlash enabled, site URL configured
- `server.js`: expects AWS credentials, Cognito client ID, and `JWT_SECRET`
